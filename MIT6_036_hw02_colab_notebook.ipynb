Note that this generates linearly separable data and then \"flips\" the labels with some specified probability (the argument pflip); so most of the results will not be linearly separable. You can also specifiy pflip in the call to the generator. You should use the default values of th and th_0 to retain consistency with the Tutor.\n",
